# Software Development Lifecycle for Research Software Engineering

A toolkit for documentation and processes for software development in a research setting. 

This repository was established by [King's Digital Lab](www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk)  (KDL) on Aug 22 2018 and it is intended to be an evolving piece of work, enriched with community contributions.

The documentation found here represents the KDL's implementation of an Agile software development lifecycle, pragmatically adapted to suit the particular requirements and peculiarities of Research Software Development. 

## How to use this resource
*Document guidance and templates have been written in simple Markdown. They can be copied and pasted into most desktop word processing software or converted via a variety of third party tools into formats that can be easily used offline.*

### Getting started
The core component of this toolkit is the document templates that underpin the various stages of the SDLC.  In addition to the document templates, there are guidance documents which offer advice on how to populate the documents and what factors to consider when planning a RSE project.
