A repository for documentation and processes for software development in a research setting. 

This repo was started on Aug 22 2018 and is intended to be an evolving piece of work.

Additional conventions for adding documents to this repository is as follows:
1. Headers are presented in Helvetica (18pt, 16pt, 14pt)
2. Body text is presented in Times (11pt)
3. Line spacing is 1.5 units
4. Boiler plate text is in black
5. Text to be replaced is in red
6. Terms which relate to specific project stages and roles are emphasised by bold type and are underlined. This also applies to abbreviations.
