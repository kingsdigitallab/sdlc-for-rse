# sdlc-for-rse
A repository for documentation and processes for software development in a research setting. This repo was created on Aug 22 2018 and is a work in progress

The documentation included in this repository should be in Open Document Format (ODF) ISO/IEC 26300 to esnure non-reliance on proprietary standards.

The documents are designed to ensure maximum availability across operating systems, using common fonts. The original documentation has been prepared using LibreOffice 6.1.0.3 (https://www.libreoffice.org/)


Additional protocol for adding documents to this repository is as follows:
1. Headers are presented in Helvetica
2. Body text is presented in Times
3. Line spacing is 1.5 units
4. Boiler plate text is in black
5. Text to be replaced is in red
6. Terms which relate to specific project stages and roles are emphasised by bold type and are underlined. This also applies to abbreviations.
