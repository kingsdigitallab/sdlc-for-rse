# Terms of Reference Guidelines
## 1. Purpose of the document
The Terms of Reference (ToR) document is created based on initial contact with the potential partner(s). It can be produced by any member of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team, though it will usually be created by the team member occupying the [Research Software Analyst](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/sdlc-for-rse/blob/master/RSE_Roles/Research_Software_Analyst.md) (RSA) role. It is not intended to be a customer facing document but rather a record for the RSE team of the main requirements identified in the project and it will be used for regular referral during the early stages of the project.

If the RSE team choose to adopt a [Project Planning](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/sdlc-for-rse/blob/master/Glossary_of_terms.md/#project-planning) stage the information in th document can be used to inform decisions about whether or not the research fits well with your institutional goals and your team remit. It may also be a helpful early indicator of feasibility.

At a minimum it should cover the high-level concepts in sufficient detail to enable discussion of the appropriate technical and management strategies with entire RSE team at the [Feasibility](https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/sdlc-for-rse/blob/master/Document_guidance/B2_Feasibility_guidance.md) stage.

Although each section of the ToR is discrete there will inevitably be overlapping details and priorities between the sections.

## 2. Completing the ToR

### 2.1 OVERVIEW section

This section of the ToR is for recording an outline of the high-level concept(s) of the research and outputs being proposed. It presents an opportunity to gain an understanding of the goals of the research and the motivations of the team involved and value judgements should be avoided at this stage.

The matrix below offers some prompts and key questions for completing this section effectively. It is not intended to be exhaustive but instead aims to stimulate conversation during the initial meetings.

|**Example questions and prompts**| **Check**  ||
|--|--|--|
|What knowledge domains are being explored?
|What disciplines does the research draw on?
|What data sources are being considered for use?
|Which established methodologies will be used?
|What skills are needed within the project team?
|What concrete outputs are anticipated to come from the research?
|How is the project team structured in terms of institutions, responsibilities and leadership?
|What other organisations are involved?
|What level of funding is secured?
|Who are the intended audiences for the project?
|How will the intended audiences interact with the research outputs?
|What is the time span for the project? Submission deadlines? Commencement?
|What expectations are there for the project beyond the funded period?
|What sort of archiving should be planned for?
|**Prompts for further feedback after the meeting:**
|*Ask the team to describe a number of **user journeys** through the project outputs*
|*Encourage them to provide a 1 or 2 sentence elevator pitch to focus their vision*

### 2.2 BACKGROUND CONTEXT section

This section provides a space to record information that can feed into decision making during the **Project Planning** stage.

The matrix below offers a selection of helpful prompts which can guide the RSE team when making a decision about whether to proceed to the **Feasibility** stage.

|**Example questions and prompts**| **Check**  ||
|--|--|--|
|Have the RSE team had previous experience of working with this project team or members of the team?
|Will the project team fully engage with the SDLC processes?
|What previous work (if any) is being built upon?
|Has previous work in this area failed to produce quality research? If so, why?
|Is there an existing resource upon which this new work depends?
|What distinguishes this research as particularly ambitious or innovative?
|Does the project align with current internal goals and strategies?
|Does the project align with internal research interests?
|Does the RSE team have access to the necessary expertise to fulfil the project requirements?
|How amenable to digitisation are the data sources being proposed?
|How amenable to archiving is the project being proposed?
|Are the ambitions of the team realistic?
|Does the project present ethical concerns?

### 2.3 REQUIREMENTS section

This section is used to summarise the main deliverables of the project. Although prioritisation might not be practical or desirable at this stage, it is worth attempting to identify those outputs that, if not delivered, would compromise the rationale of the project. All requirements should be considered from infrastructure upwards.
