# Terms of Reference Guidelines
## 1. Purpose of the document
The Terms of Reference (ToR) document is created based on initial contact with the project partner or partners. It can be produced by any member of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team, though it will usually be created by the team member occupying the Research Software Analyst role. It is not intended to be a customer facing document but rather a record for the RSE team of the main requirements and will be used for referral during the early stages of the project.

If the RSE team choose to adopt a **Project Planning Approval** stage, the information in this document can be used to inform decisions about whether or not the research fits well with your institutional goals and your team remit.

At a minimum it should cover the high-level concept in sufficient detail to discuss the appropriate technical and management strategies with entire RSE team at the **Feasibility** stage.

Although each section is discrete, there will inevitably be overlapping details and priorities between the sections.

```mermaid

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:
