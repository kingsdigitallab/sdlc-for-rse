# Terms of Reference Guidelines
## 1. Purpose of the document
The Terms of Reference (ToR) document is created based on initial contact with the potential project partner(s). It can be produced by any member of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) team, though it will usually be created by the team member occupying the Research Software Analyst (RSA) role. It is not intended to be a customer facing document but rather a record for the RSE team of the main requirements identified in the project and it will be used for regular referral during the early stages of the project.

If the RSE team choose to adopt a **Project Planning Approval** stage the information in the ToR document can be used to inform decisions about whether or not the research fits well with your institutional goals and your team remit. It may also be a helpful early indicator of feasibility.

At a minimum it should cover the high-level concepts in sufficient detail to enable discussion of the appropriate technical and management strategies with entire RSE team at the **Feasibility** stage.

Although each section of the ToR is discrete there will inevitably be overlapping details and priorities between the sections.
